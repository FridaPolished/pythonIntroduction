#tuples are a sequence of Python objects.
#they are inmutable but they can be useful because they respond
#to most operations related to strings and to numbers
#tuples are defined with ()
#useful when we need to iterate and access to the information without modifying it
tuple_1 = ('cat', 'dog', 'rat')
tuple_2 = tuple_1 + tuple_1

print(tuple_1)
print(tuple_2)

# tuple_1[0] = "bird"
# print(tuple_1)
# print(tuple_2)

#we cant remove values or modify them in any way but we can create new
#tuples
